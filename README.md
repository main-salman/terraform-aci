# Automate ACI deployment with Terraform!
This repository and accompanying [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6y0C4vKIg&ab_channel=SalmanNaqvi) shows how you can use Terraform to configure ACI. The demo crates a tenant, application profile and three EPGs. The video is meant to demonstrate how easy it is to use Terraform to configure ACI vs other options like Ansible, Python, CLI or GUI.
